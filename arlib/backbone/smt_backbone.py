"""
Backbone clauses generation via lazy model enumeration
  Consider a set of predicates S = {p1, ..., pn}
  A clause C is the disjunction of a subset of literals, each of the literal
   uses predicates from S (e.g., a literal can be p1, not p1, ....)

  If F |= C, then we say C is a backbone clause of F w.r.t. S.
   F |= C means Not(F -> C) is unsat, which means F and (not C) is unsat.

   For example, let C be "p1 or p2 or p3". To check whether C is a backbone clause of F or not,
   We need to show that "F and (not p1) and (not p2) and (not p3)" is unsatisfiable.
   Then, maybe we can reduce to something like "unsat core enumeration"?

   (FIXME: how to tell an SMT solver that "the unsat core must contain F")

 - Generation (an arbitrary one?), or sampling (a set of backbones), or enumeration (all)?
 - Restrict the length of the clause?
 - Where is S from?

TODO:
  - Combination with predicate abstraction
    + Predicate abstraction aims to compute the strongest consequence of F, which is expressible as a
    Boolean combination of S. (e.g., p1 or (not p2))
    + Backbone clauses enumeration aims to compute all blabla....?
  - Comparison with SAT backbone
    + SAT backbone:
    + ...?
  - Comparison with Unsat core enumeration? (Maybe we can reuse some existing algorithms)
