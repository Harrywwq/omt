# Solution Sampling for Various Constraints

NOTICE: We do sampling, not enumeration, counting, volume estimation, or optimization (they are closely-related topics)

## Dependences

The minimal require software is Z3.
You can install it via

`pip install z3-solver --user`

To enable more features, you may install other packages

~~~~
numpy: for Dikin walk, etc.
pyeda: for BDD-related staff
pysmt: for interacting with other SMT solvers
