Solving Quantified Problems
-----

The basic idea of quantifier instantiation is to replace a quantified formula with
a finite set of instances that are obtained by substituting concrete terms for the quantified variables.

-----

Quantifier elimination refers to the process of eliminating the quantifiers from a formula by
 constructing an equivalent quantifier-free formula.
