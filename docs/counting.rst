==========
Introduction to Model Counting
==========

Model counting is the problem of determining the number of possible solutions
(models) to a given formula. It is a fundamental problem in computer 
science and has applications in various fields such as artificial intelligence, cryptography, and verification.

Model Counting for SAT Formulas
-----


To count models for SAT formulas, please use ``sharpSAT`` or other third-party tools.

Model Counting for QF_BV Formulas
-----


QF_BV stands for quantifier-free bit-vector logic. It is a subset of the SMT-LIB standard and is commonly used in the analysis and verification of computer hardware and software systems. 

To count the models of a QF_BF formula, refer to 
- ``arlib\bv\qfbv_counting.py``.
- ``arlib\tests\test_bv_counting.py``

Note that we rely on sharpSAT for the implementation. Currently, you need to either copy a 
binary version of sharpSAT to ``bin_solvers`` or install a sharpSAT globally.
