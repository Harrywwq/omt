* Solving general quantified SMT formulas
* Quantifier elimination
* Sampling solutions of SMT formulas
* Counting the models of SMT formulas
* Optimization Modulo Theory (OMT) solving
* Interpolant generation
* Minimal satisfying assignment
* Symbolic abstraction
* Abductive inference
* Knowledge compilation
* MaxSAT, MaxSMT, and OMT
* QBF solving
* Formula rewritings/simplifications
* ...
